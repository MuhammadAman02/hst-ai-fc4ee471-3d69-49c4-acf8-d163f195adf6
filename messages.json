    "content": "Executive Summary  \n\n \n\nWhat does the Project entail?   \n\nHST Solutions is developing a secure document validation application aimed at assisting Credit Unions in identifying and preventing fraud during the customer veri\ufb01cation process. The application will streamline  backend checks on frequently submitted documents such as bank statements, payslips, Irish Residency  Permits (IRP), Personal Public Service Numbers (PPSN), and tax-related records.   \n\nThe system will utilize a rules-based validation engine to examine critical parameters such as document  formatting, employee and employer details, cross-document veri\ufb01cations, income declarations, transaction consistency, etc.. These backend checks will help detect irregularities and potential document tampering  with a high degree of accuracy.   \n\nThe application will also generate results after validation, highlighting anomalies and potential red \ufb02ags,  enabling faster decision-making and reducing the burden of manual review.   \n\nThis solution is designed to enhance document veri\ufb01cation work\ufb02ows, reduce operational risks, and  support regulatory compliance, providing \ufb01nancial institutions with a dependable tool to safeguard  against fraud.   \nProblem Statement:   \n\n1.  Challenges Faced in Manual Document Verification  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.  Lack of Reliable Document Authenticity Validation   \n\na.   Problem  in  identifying  forged  documents  that  imitate  legitimate  formats.  Fraudulent  \n\ndocuments  often  include  manipulated  logos,  photo  mismatch,  incorrect  templates,  or falsi\ufb01ed tax forms, making it dif\ufb01cult to differentiate between genuine and counterfeit sources.   \n\n2.  Inconsistencies and Errors Within Documents   \n\na.   Manual  reviewers  frequently  miss  internal  inconsistencies  such  as mismatched salary  \n\n\ufb01gures, incorrect carry-forward balances, or discrepancies in date \ufb01elds like DOB. These oversights can result in inaccurate eligibility assessments or undetected fraud.   \n\n3.  Mismatch of Information Across Documents   \n\na.   Cross-document inconsistencies, such as variations in names, dates of birth, employer  \n\ndetails, or mismatched salary \ufb01gures between payslips and bank statements, often go unnoticed, compromising the integrity of the veri\ufb01cation process.   \n\n4.  Non-Compliance with Regulatory and Structural Standards   \n\na.   Many submitted documents fail to meet country-speci\ufb01c regulatory formats (e.g., IBAN,  \n\nPPS numbers, tax code structures), creating additional friction in compliance and increasing the risk of accepting invalid information.   \n\n5.  Behavioral Patterns Indicative of Fraud Go Undetected   \n\na.   Manual checks are unable to effectively identify contextual red \ufb02ags, such as unusually high  \n\nor rounded salaries, irregular transaction patterns, or document reuse across unrelated applications\u2014common signs of organized fraud attempts.   \n1.  Document Authenticity Checks   \n\nThese focus on verifying whether the document is genuinely issued by a legitimate authority.   \n\na.   Template matching with of\ufb01cial layouts   \n\nb.   Veri\ufb01cation of government seals, watermarks, and holograms  c.   Logo placement and font type validation   \n\nd.   Tax document format veri\ufb01cation (e.g., Revenue, HMRC)   \n\ne.   Driver\u2019s license category and issue authority matching   \n\n2.  Content Consistency & Integrity Checks   \n\nThese checks ensure the data within the document is internally consistent and logically sound.   \n\na.   Cross-\ufb01eld consistency (e.g., same name across pages, salary math in payslips)  b.   Consistent dates (e.g., DOB)   \n\nc.   Matching totals, deductions, and net pay   \n\nd.   Balance carry-forward checks in bank statements   \n\ne.   Salary credited matches the payslip amount   \n\n3.  Cross-Document Veri\ufb01cation   \n\nThese are inter-document checks to validate that information aligns across multiple sources.   \n\na.   Name, DOB, and address match across all documents  b.   PPS number in tax documents vs. residence permit   \n\nc.   Salary in bank statements matches the payslip   \n\nd.   Employer name in payslip vs. tax statement   \n\n4.  Regulatory & Structural Validation   \n\nThese checks con\ufb01rm that documents follow the structural and regulatory requirements set by  \n\nof\ufb01cial entities.   \n\na.   PPS number structure validation (Ireland: 7 digits + 1/2 letters)   \n\nb.   Bank account number format (e.g., IBAN, sort code)   \n\n \n\n Freeform 107, ShapeFreeform 108, ShapeFreeform 109, Shapec.   Tax code format validation (e.g., TIN/PAN)  [Text Wrapping Break]5.  Behavioral & Contextual Analysis   \n\nThese checks apply a contextual or pattern-based lens to catch fraud based on historical trends.  \n\na.   Salary is too high or round values for the expected role   \n\nb.   Inconsistent frequency of deposits (e.g., multiple salaries per month)   \n\nc.   Spikes in transaction activity before the application   \n\nd.   Similar documents submitted across unrelated applications (fraud ring)   \n\nEmpowering Credit Unions with Intelligent, Scalable Fraud Detection   \n\nHST Solutions will develop an advanced fraud detection platform, which will be designed to enhance the accuracy, speed, and ef\ufb01ciency of document veri\ufb01cation processes \u2014 a critical requirement in today\u2019s  high-risk environment.   \n\nThe solution will include the following components:   \n\n\u25cf   Document Processing System: The platform will utilize robust data processing capabilities to   \n\nhandle high-risk customer documents such as bank statements, payslips, tax records, photo  mismatch, PPSNs, and identity documents.   \n\n\u25cf   Business Rules for Veri\ufb01cation: A set of prede\ufb01ned rules will guide the document veri\ufb01cation  process, ensuring that only valid and authentic documents are approved for further processing.   \n\n\u25cf   Data Extraction Mechanism: Key data points from submitted documents will be extracted for   \n\nanalysis, enabling a seamless \ufb02ow of information for validation.   \n\n\u25cf   Data Validation Checks: The extracted data will undergo rigorous validation checks to ensure   \n\nconsistency, accuracy, and authenticity. This includes cross-checking with of\ufb01cial databases, such  as tax authorities and public registries.   \n\n\u25cf   Exception Handling: Any discrepancies or potential fraud indicators will be \ufb02agged as exceptions,  \n\nallowing compliance teams to review and investigate high-risk cases quickly and ef\ufb01ciently.   \n\n\n"

    "content": "All the checks you have implmented are not real. ensure it does the following 1. Data Validation & Consistency Checks These are rules-based checks to confirm internal and external consistency: a. Internal Consistency: Arithmetic consistency: Sum of credits/debits should match the reported balance changes. Date sequence validity: Transactions should follow chronological order. Repetition anomalies: Unusual repetitions in transaction descriptions or amounts. 2. Document Integrity & Forensics If you're dealing with scanned or uploaded PDFs: Image forensics: Detect pixel-level inconsistencies (e.g., signs of editing in Photoshop). Metadata analysis: Look for suspicious timestamps or document generators. Font and spacing analysis: Inconsistencies in typography, alignment, or formatting. Hash validation: If a secure checksum is provided (e.g., from a bank portal), verify it. 3. Anomaly & Behavioural Analysis Using pattern recognition and statistical models: Unusual transactions: Large or rare transfers not aligned with past behavior. Round-number frequency: Excessive transactions in perfect multiples of 10, 100, etc. Location-based anomalies: Transactions from geographically improbable locations. Missing transactions: Gaps or missing regular expenses (e.g., rent, groceries). 4. Machine Learning/AI-Based Detection For systems with sufficient training data: Supervised models: Trained classifiers (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Nets) to classify statements as fraudulent or genuine based on features. Unsupervised models: Use clustering or anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to find outliers. Time-series analysis: LSTM or other recurrent models to detect abnormal temporal patterns. Common features for ML: Frequency of certain transaction types Ratio of credit vs debit Transaction description entropy Time between deposits/withdrawals 5. Red Flags to Watch For Some heuristics known to signal document manipulation: Mismatched fonts or alignment in key fields like account number or closing balance Inconsistent statement periods or date overlaps Bank logo misplacement or poor quality (common in fake statements) Altered PDFs with missing digital signatures 6. Optional Advanced Checks OCR + NLP for statement extraction: Convert scanned statements into structured data and analyse. Comparison against known genuine templates: Use template matching to detect layout tampering. Blockchain or checksum verification: If banks offer hash-signed statements."
